# Medication Adherence is crucial -- And hard
![daily pillbox](assets/pillboxes-2048.jpg)

^ Doctors can prescribe medications, but they can't make patients take them. 

^ And patients with more serious conditions or less capacity may have much more involved medication regimes -- precisely when they're least able to adhere to doctors' recommendations.

# Basic Reminders Don't Help Much

![fill](assets/effective-health-communication-older-adults-inline_0.jpg)

[Lots]() of [research]() exists to try to [improve]() medication adherence. 

Nothing works as well as conversations with patients' loved ones.

# Proposal: Relationship-Based Reminders
We can't give every patient a conversation with their loved ones every day.
But maybe we can get closer.

# Hearance: AI Powered, Relationship-based Medication Adherence System



---

# Project Sections:

- Web app for managing medication schedules
- LLM-based conversation system
- Database storage for tracking daily conversations

---

# Setbacks and Cautions

- High costs of phone-based AI conversations
- HIPAA concerns
- Fraud Risk

--- 

# Experimental Validation
- To show Hearance is effective, we'd need to run randomized controlled trials
- Experimental Conditions:
  - No intervention
  - Automated reminders
  - Conversational AI reminders
  - Family member reminders

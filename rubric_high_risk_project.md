# High Risk Project
Due: Mon Apr 28, 2025 11:59pm

The goal of this assignment is for your to take on a high-risk project that you always wanted to try but were afraid to fail. Here you can fail in your aim and still achieve a high score on your assignment. Grading will be based on your level of effort, not how great your results were. For this reason, we encourage you not to choose something that will be an easy task for you. Even you will fail miserably in the end and produce no result or bad results, as long you have tried hard you can still get a high score on this assignment. 

## Learning Outcomes
- Design a project related to AI in healthcare.
- Use various technologies and methods to create an approach to solving a healthcare question. 
- Write an ACM-style research report. 
- Present the findings of your project in a recorded presentation. 

## Forming Teams

This assignment can be done individually or in collaboration with peers from your course. We invite you to post in Ed Discussion about your interests to connect with other people in the course. Teams can consist of a maximum of 3 people. Teams must be formed and finalized at least 2 weeks before the assignment is due. 

To form your team, create and/or sign up under "High-risk Project Groups" on the People tab. 

## Potential Topics

The topic you choose will have the most impact on the eventual design and shape of your project. Think carefully about where your interests lie, what will be possible in the time you have this semester, and what the combined interests and skills of your potential group members are when deciding on a topic.  

The most important goal of this project is to try to come out of your comfort zone to explore something new. Do not be afraid of failing. Failing is the part of learning process. Nowadays, new knowledge has been acquired through being curious and having the audacity to try.  

Some example topics including: 
- Building an AI method for health risk prediction.
- Using LLM models to solve health issues.
- Implement explainable AI methods in healthcare. Read about [Su-In Lee's lab for more](https://aims.cs.washington.edu/su-in-lee). She and her team research using explainable AI in healthcare.
- Create a tool to analyze clinical notes.
- Write a report related to social sides of AI in Health (such as ethical, legal, and fairness of AI in health). [Here is an example](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14930.pdf).

If you like to work on LLM related topics. Here is the [summary I wrote](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1407051/files/81542279?wrap=1) I wrote about the content I learned from NeurIPS2023 in New Orleans, which might be able to provide some ideas for your high-risk project.

## Project Steps
### Step 1: Form a Project Plan

Once you have a team and potential topic, you'll need to create a plan for executing your project. Start by creating objectives and a scope for your project. Make sure to give yourself plenty of time to analyze the results, write your report, and record your final presentation.  

If you have need help shaping and scoping your project, feel free to visit Office Hours for guidance. 

### Step 2: Write your Report

Write a less than 5 page report (under 4000 words, in ACM format) about your findings. We recommend that you use the [ACM workshop paper template](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow) for formatting. 

Your report should include: 

  - Introduction - Clearly state the problem you wanted to solve. - Be persuasive, and convince your readers that this problem is important.
  - Related Work - List 2 or 3 related projects and how they dealt with the same or a similar problem. You can try starting your search on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) .It is even better to choose peer-reviewed articles from journals or conferences related to your topic. You have access to a wide selection of scholarly journals through the library catalogs
  - Methodology - Outline the methods you took to deal with the problem you laid out in the introduction section. This section must include at least one figure that illustrates your workflow. Your figure may detail how data was collected and processed or how your methods were implemented and applied.

### Step 3: Record Your Presentation

After you have completed your report, record a presentation about your project that tells your audience all about your work. This presentation should be no more than 5 minutes and should include:

- Introduction - What is your project about? Why it is important?
- Method - Details about your methods including data and methodology.
- Results - What are your major results and their implications?
- Future Directions - What are things that you would do differently if you had the chance to redo the project? What are the future directions do you think the project could go in?
- Demo (optional) - Show your code or do a short demo of your project.

You are required to use slides to present this information. There are a lot of options for recording a slide deck with audio or video, including the tools built into PowerPoint, Zoom, and [Panopto](https://utexas.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=67adab23-c873-40d2-b9f6-ac06017c6405)


Once you have your video file, upload it into the [assignment folder in Panopto](https://utexas.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=d95e432e-a8e4-41d8-abba-b2c0015a7153)
. Please label your video with the last names and first initials of all team members. 

### Deliverables

- A report with less than 5 pages using the  ACM template 
- Presentation slides
- Code (with the link to your Github or other codebase)
- Presentation video (< 5 min.) 

Since you can only submit one file in Canvas, please include a cover page at the beginning of your report with links to your presentation, code repository, and video in Panopto.
